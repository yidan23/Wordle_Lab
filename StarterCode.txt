How you divide the tasks in different classes is up to you, but here are some functions that you may want to implement

I recommend using at least a tester and game class

randomWord(){
  grabs a random word from the list and removes/moves said word from the list
  set said word to variable
}

makeGuess(){
  //you may want to put this into a while loop that ends on a certain number of guesses
  player inputs their guess
  checks if correct
  responds accordingly
}

you also would want to use an ArrayList or array to display the grid
printBoard(){
  prints 2d array
}

showGuessed(){
  show letters already guessed
}

Things to consider:
- How can we make this replayable
- How do we communicate colors?
- What happens if someone tries to enter in too short or long of a word?
- Show the letters already guessed?
- how to go about comparing input and target words
- what if player tries to input numbers, etc. 

YOU GOT THIS! :)
