Wordle is a game, perse. But more than a game, its a culture. What is the goal? To win. And to do that, one has to guess the word(le). Wordle has had a massive impact in the realm of leisure gaming. The goal is to guess the random word, using hints given by the game. 

Pseudocode:
1. make random five letter word
2. give player oppurtunity to guess random word
3. if one of the letters they guessed is in the word but not in the right place, it should appear yellow
4. if one of the letters they guessed is in the word and in the right place, it should appear green
5. the player gets 6 guesses to get the word, or else they lose (and die)
